Doctors are expected to have a form of wisdom. People ask me many things, some I feel qualified to talk about, others are so far out of my comfort zone, I'm can't see it from where I stand. In the ten years or so that I've been a doctor, I've met tens of thousands of people. Enough to fill a small town. We acquire wisdom with each and every patient we meet.

****

We hear of success and failure, joy and despair, trial and tribulation. We absorb the secrets of others, lock them away in our minds and never share them. We live vicariously through the lives of others.

My job is an exhausting privilege. A privilege that is getting harder to maintain with increasing patient numbers, increasing illness, and decreasing time in which to do my job. 

****

Our species is truly amazing. We create and destroy beauty in equal measure. We unite in adversity, yes fight over the small things that make us different. We are forged from the very elements that came into existence at the dawn of time. We have evolved into the most successful, and arguably most stupid species on the planet. We get energy from the sun in a day, than we would use in a year, and yet we'll go to war over dead dinosaur juice buried under a desert. 

****

One thing that saddens me in my day job is the lack of importance that people bestow upon them selves. Each of us is unique. There is no other copy of us in this universe, yet I meet countless people who don't realise just how special and important they are. For whatever reason, be it an abusive childhood, controlling relationship, or lack of confidence or self esteem, some people don't seem to like themselves. This may lead onto problems with depression or anxiety, or failure to act on opportunities that may come their way.

****

This might sound like a departure from the day job, but making a difference to people is why we do it.  Problems with self esteem and confidence can be severe, crippling in some senses, and prevent people from achieving their full potential.

and search for self-esteem. Confidence and belief in oneself have a direct impact on how we operate in the world.
