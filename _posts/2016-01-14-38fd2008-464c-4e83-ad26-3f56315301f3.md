**Maximise your memory**

We all forget things. Every experience and memory is altered, subject to differences in perception, recall and importance. Our memories are on one hand brilliant, and on the other utterly unreliable. Eye-witness testimony as used in court cases is about the lowest quality evidence there is. We all walk into rooms now and again, and forget why we're there. I have a good memory for faces, but names? I am frequently embarrassed in social settings.

"This is my wife....and this is...er....a colleague of mine".

"You've forgotten my name haven't you".

"Yup".

This scenario has played out throughout my entire life.

For most of us, everyday memory failures are nothing more than that. Temporary lapses in memory. Busy lives or a vain attempt at multi-tasking may redirect our attention. I've we haven't paid attention, we're less likely to remember it. (This might be why I forget everything my wife says!) For others, this might mark the onset of dementia.

What are the early signs of dementia?

This could be subtle in the early stages. Forgotten names are not uncommon, but confusion over dates or times might feature. People may get disorientated in time or place. Someone might start wondering off, or get lost in usually familiar places. People with dementia are often easily upset by changes in routine. You might notice personality change. Emotions may come to the fore. Normally placid people may become violent, happy become tearful.

So far as we know, there isn't much we can do to prevent dementia once it takes hold. For those of us with a normal, but perhaps slightly leaky memory, there are somethings we can do.

We tend to remember things visually. We're evolved to pay attention to things out of the ordinary. Anyone who has watched "Sherlock" will be familiar with the concept of the "mind palace". A place familiar to you, with the things you need to memorise symbolised by images or things. This is a method that many memory experts use.

If I have to remember a long list, I picture my childhood home. Each object or task is represented by an image or item. We often remember the more bizarre, or even obscene situations, in more detail. I tried it this year with my Christmas shopping, and I didn't forget a thing. I won't tell you what I imagined to remember them. Safe to say, my wife was happy with her purse, wellies, watch, perfume etc etc.

Here are some tips on how to help your memory:

1. Your body is a life support vehicle for your brain. Look after it. A healthy, balanced diet and regular exercise are key. You'll feel better for it

2. Get plenty of sleep. Sleep is when the chemicals in our brain (called neurotransmitters) tend to replenish. Sleep helps memories stick too. Get an early night now and again. Or better still, every night.

3. Pay attention - you won't remember what you haven't seen or heard, so pay close attention to the subject at hand.

4. Create a mind palace - hook your memories to a familiar place. The stranger the image, the more it sticks.

So next time I meet someone, if you can hear the cogwheels whirring, I'm paying attention and coming up with an image to help it stick. Now I'm off for a work out and an early night.
