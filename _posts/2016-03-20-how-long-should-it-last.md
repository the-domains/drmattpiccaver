_How long should it last?_

Even in the dying days of the NHS, sometimes, just sometimes, people can get an appointment with their doctor. I don't want to be responsible for anyone fainting when I make such a statement. I know, unheard of right?

**  
**

Forgive the tongue lodged firmly in cheek there. Many of us in the industry feel we're seeing the last days of the National Health Service. Over stretched and underfunded. Junior doctors leaving the profession or the country, GPs retiring early, and many hospital specialities seeing unprecedented vacancy rates. I do fear that my generation of doctors might be the last people standing, as it were. Senior colleagues left, with few juniors passing through the ranks to support them. 

**

Yes despite the perceived pressure on appointments, I meet many people in the early stages of illness. A day of fever, two days of cough. I even met someone who had been unwell for twenty minutes. 

**

The government are keen for people to present early. For suspected cancers, this is desperately important. Warts can probably wait a while.

**

One of the commonest things I get asked, is how long will a disease last? This is often quite a challenge, particularly in the very early days. For many infectious disease, there is an approximate time course which makes it easier.

**  
**

Most middle ear infections - otitis media - last around four days. They often present with pain, usually in one ear, and a possible fever. They'll usually settle with time but can be very painful, so pain relief is key. 

**  
**

Most sore throats last a week. If you're otherwise well, they usually don't need more than time and pain relief. The common cold can last for about ten days. I often meet people who have "had this cold for a week and it won't go away". Give it a few more days, and the vast majority will have settled.

**  
**

Sinusitis, that feeling of pressure in the forehead or cheeks, along with a cold and blocked nose, can take nearly three weeks to settle. Once again, if you're otherwise well, time and pain relief are the order of the day.  

**  
**

Coughs and bronchitis last three weeks. Many coughs last up to three weeks without there being a sinister cause. Once again, if you're feeling well otherwise, give it some time and chances are it will settle. A little green sputum (phlegm) probably isn't much to worry about, particularly if you're feeling ok.

The question is, when should we worry? Prolonged illness, e.g. a cough for more than three weeks, warrants further investigation. High temperatures, especially over 38 C, coughing up blood, unable to take fluids, or just generally getting sicker and sicker are worries in their own right. You'll need urgent medical attention if this is happening. 

**  
**

This list is by no means exhaustive. Some things, like serious symptoms suggestive of cancer, or heart disease need urgent attention. Minor self limiting illness is exactly what it is. Most settle fairly quickly, and don't make us feel too unwell.
