**When to worry?**

A lot of people I meet aren't that ill. Thankfully. They think they are ill. They have symptoms that cause them concern. They come to see me. I talk with them, listen and more often than not, reassure.

But not everyone's that lucky. Whilst most people are mostly well, some people I meet are rather unwell. Beyond peaky, into the "blimey you look rough" territory.

The doctor's appointment is rather more complex than first seems. After the initial introductions, the patient has to explain how they feel. They turn vague, physical symptoms into a language of words and gestures. I then have to interpret that, and turn a notion of being unwell into a biological, pathological process. This is not as easy as you'd think. Nuance and meaning may be lost between the patient's feelings and the doctors mind.

The question many people ask me is, "should I be worried?". It is often difficult to know when we should worry, and when we shouldn't. A cough for a week or two is probably of little consequence, but how long should we let things linger before we seek help. Should we worry if we're unintentionally losing weight?

As a doctor I have guidelines which help us decide if we need someone to be seen for a suspect cancer. They are quite general, and most people I meet with these symptoms DON'T have a serious illness. However, it is important that if you have some of these features, to get seen.

So when do I worry?

Anyone with a prolonged cough, especially if they have smoked in their time, should see their doctor. Coupled with fatigue, shortness of breath, weight loss and appetite loss may be a cause for concern, especially if this has gone on for a few weeks.

Problems swallowing are a definite concern, especially if you feel that food gets stuck. That needs addressing urgently, so get in touch with your doctor. New onset heartburn in some one 55 years and up needs to see their doctor. People with an unexplained loss of weight, change in bowel habit (diarrhoea mainly) and rectal bleeding need to get in touch with their doctor. Breast lumps, especially in the over 30's, need attending to. Bleeding after intercourse - another cause for concern.

The "red flags" of suspected serious illness are many and varied. Most people I meet don't have a serious underlying disease, but now and again we find cancer.

The list above is by no means exhaustive. In short, if you have more or less any prolonged and unexplained symptoms, it might be worth discussing it with your doctor?

So when should I worry? When my patient worries. If in doubt get in touch with your doctor. We might be busy, it might take us some time to get back to you, but we're here to help.
