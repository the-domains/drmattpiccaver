**Suicide by Doctors**

The sense of self-preservation in strong in our species. Hardwired, a built-in mechanism to ensure that we survive to pass our DNA onto the next generation. Accompanied by fight, fright or flight, we are alert to the presence of danger. We are built to live, for a while at least.

What must be going on in a person's mind in order to die at their own hands? A malfunction of our in-built desire to live, or a life so painful that death is the only cure.

It is part of the human condition to have a "dark night of the soul". Depression is incredibly common, and yet only a small number of those with depression will go onto die by suicide.

Some professions are risky when it comes to suicide. Vets, dentists, and doctors have access to the means. They are more likely to be successful. If you can save a life, you can all too easily end one.

Medicine is not unique in being a high pressured career. Years of training, endless exams, and the responsibility over life and death soon take their toll. It is hard to absorb the suffering of others and come out unscathed. In my career I have met tens of thousands of people. Tens of thousands of tales of suffering and despair. Sooner or later it rubs off. Is it any wonder that doctors are at a higher risk of ending their own life?

Between 2005 and 2013, twenty-eight doctors undergoing investigation by the GMC died by suicide. Receiving "the letter" from the General Medical Council can strike fear into the hearts of many doctors. For some, the pressure of investigation may be too much. For other's, personal problems may provoke their final action. Relationship problems or the pressures of work have been implicated in the suicide of doctors.

Nigel Praities is the editor of Pulse, a leading trade publication for doctors. Last year Pulse conducted the largest ever survey of GP burnout. "Half of GPs were at high risk of burning out completely", adding,  "there is rising concern about the pressure being placed on GPs, and in particular the number of deaths by suicide during fitness to practice procedures by the General Medical Council".

Dr Pete Deveson, a GP from Surrey, elaborates:

'The problem with medicine is it expects you to witness endless suffering and death without blinking, whilst simultaneously stealing time you might use to develop and access a support network'.

To counter this, the GMC has appointed Professor Appleby from the University of Manchester to advise on how to support vulnerable doctors. 

Professor Louis Appleby said,

'Suicides by doctors facing investigation by the GMC are tragic evidence of the distress that may be experienced in these circumstances.

'I will be helping the GMC examine how it deals with doctors who may be vulnerable or at risk, to ensure it does everything possible to support them, while fulfilling its over-riding duty to protect patients and the public.'

The pressure under which doctors find themselves is only to increase. Applications to medical school have fallen. Swathes of doctors are leaving to work abroad. A third of GPs are set to retire in the next five years. Patients are getting older and sicker, and the NHS feels like it is bursting at the seams. How this will affect the workforce remains to be seen, but it is without doubt that pressures will increase affecting all staff within the NHS.

The psychiatrist Carl Jung talked of the wounded healer. The desire to heal coming from an inner "wound". By fixing others, we fix ourselves. Doctors are prone to the same maladies as their patients, perhaps even more so.
