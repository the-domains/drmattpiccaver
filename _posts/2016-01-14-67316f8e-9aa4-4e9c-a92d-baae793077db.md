**Tips for New Dads**

As a GP, I am often expected to know a little bit of something about everything. Or perhaps more accurately, everything about everything. It often comes as a surprise to some that this is not the case. Like many, I seem to be able to retain bizarre facts. For instance, did you know that the opossum sperm has two tails. Nope? Well you do now. When this managed to burrow its way into my head, and why, I have no idea.

One particular area of expertise I'm sadly lacking is that of parenting. Doctors tend to have better relationships with their consulting room than they do with their loved ones. We are always at work.

If I need advice on parenting, I ask my wife. She's much better at it, despite my best efforts.

My eldest son was born prematurely. As I wheeled him into the neonatal unit, a midwife said, "it's ok, he's a doctor, and mum's a nurse".

I was a brand new parent, as clueless as anyone else. A small pink bundle of responsibility lay squirming in the cot. Once again, assumed to know everything about everything.

Being a brand new parent is incredibly daunting. My medical training taught me how to diagnose and care for the sick, but normal? That's a whole different ballgame. I meet countless new parents through the day job, many as scared and worried as I was.

When you have a child, everyone feels the need to share their nuggets of parenting advice. "I wouldn't do that if I were you...you want to do this, not that... that's not how you do that...", fill in the blanks as you see fit. We all think we're right, and we all say something different. So I've drawn up a by no means exhaustive list of things to remember as a new parent, particularly for fathers.

1. feed the top end, clean the bottom end, love the whole thing, the rest is detail.
2. encourage breast feeding. As a man, it is a lot easier. You don't have the right equipment for a start. Plus there's no need to get up in the night to sterilise nipples. Be the pit crew for your partner, and give them help where needed
3. you had hobbies. You had them. Now you have the ultimate responsibility of being a father. The hobbies will come back in time.
4. You will genuinely find getting socks for Christmas exciting. 

5. Everything will cost more than you think. But never fear, because relatives and friends will explode in a shower of gifts, second hand items, and pre-loved pushchairs.

6. Be prepared to be wrong. Just accept it. It's allowed and none of us get it right the first time. You'll get things right eventually

7. Your new baby is meant to sound like a piglet when they're born. Snuffling, fidgeting, squirming. You'll spend the first week lying awake listening to your new baby breathe. 

8. Your child will get ill. Hopefully nothing more than a simple cold, or mild fever. This is to be expected, and for most children this isn't much to worry about. 

9. Health visitors and midwives are brilliant. Ask them lots of questions. They know an awful lot about normal pregnancy and early childhood. 

10. Enjoy your time. Childhood is but fleeting, so try and enjoy every minute.

11. Be expected to be covered in bodily fluids. Baby sick, urine, faeces, and nasal mucus. You'll soon get used to it.

Parenting is tricky, none of us get it right all the time. It is meant to be worrying. Then one day, your children grow up and worry about you.
